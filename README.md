# About

This is a game where, in a randomly generated maze, you have to go from point A to point B. However there is a very smart green enemy that knows where you are and uses the shortest path algorithm to find you. You must either reach the destination before the enemy catches you, or kill the enemy before he catches you. You can kill the enemy by pressed a big green button.
